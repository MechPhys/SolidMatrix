# SolidMatrix: Solid particles in a matrix

> "Nature is, above all else, a meticulous accountant"

SolidMatrix is a new approach that is based on discrete particles in a discrete matrix or lattice.  These discrete particles are much better for keeping the accounting tight, but how does a hard little discrete dot move in a seemingly continuous fashion in arbitrary directions?  Interestingly, stochastic motion, where there is a certain probability of taking a step at each point in time, provides a way of smoothing the motion of these discrete particles.  This provides an interesting necessary origin story for the randomness at the heart of quantum physics, and does a great job of keeping the accounting tight.

The resulting physical model is like the deBroglie-Bohm pilot wave theory: the particles interact with a sea of surrounding fields that impart the wave-like properties of QM.

Antonio Sciarretta has developed models based on this principle, in a series of recent papers, showing how a particular formulation of the surrounding field interactions can give rise to otherwise puzzling features of quantum physics.  In particular, these field interactions introduce a novel framework for understanding interference effects, in terms of the cumulative traces left by other particles.  This twist may well provide the critical missing ingredient that finally makes the quantum world make sense: it is well-established that quantum effects manifest only over many repeated samples from "identically prepared" particles, and yet everyone interprets them in terms of physical mechanisms operating only on a single trial, associated with a single isolated particle.  This fundamental disconnect has great potential for resolving paradoxes.

Here, the approach converges with the research on the zero-point field, as developed by Santos, Marshall and others, which is synonymous with the virtual particles captured in the path-integral formulation of Feynmann and his famous diagrams.  The field is very much "alive", teaming with random "quantum foam", and this fabric of "empty" space likely plays an essential role in explaining various puzzling features of QM.  In the stochastic electrodynamics (SED) approach, the field is the exclusive source of stochastic behavior.  However, the isotrophic motion of discrete particles requires intrinsic stochasticity, thus freeing the field to play a less strongly-constrained role.

In short, we have several different models of the quantum field: the original S field formulation from Bohm, the path integral of Feynmann (which is divergent in general), the second quantized Fourier space formulation of quantum field theory, the SED / ZPF field, and Sciarretta's specific "trace" field.  Between all of these models, some kind of consistent framework should be derivable.

Sciarretta's specific formulation has some strange features, including that the interaction depends on the specific lifetime of the particle.  However, in practice the field is initialized to an equilibrium distribution, based on the configuration.

Thus, in the end, the field "senses" the configuration and imparts corresponding forces onto the particle, which is the same qualitative account as the pilot wave framework.  Furthermore, Sciarretta's model has an appealing conserving exchange process in the particle's interaction with the field.

Some other challenges for the field model include accounting for the space-time distortion effects of special relativity, which are so elegantly captured in the wave dynamics.

Although hard discrete particles make sense for fermions, which obey strict conservation principles and the Pauli exclusion principle, bosons like the troubling photon have very different properties.  They have no mass or charge, accumulate in graded amounts with fully linear superposition, always move at the speed of light, and the relevant wavelengths can be astronomically large compared to the Compton wavelength of even the lightest particles.

The momentum on the left is 0.5c while on the right is 0. The distribution of position is on the vertical axis, while time is on the horizontal axis, with each point centered at the origin in the center (i.e., the temporal autocorrelation function).  The variance on the left is half of that on the right.")

Nelson (1966) shows how brownian stochastic motion gives rise to the Schrodinger equation: a central intuition is that slow drift produces a wide cloud of space where particle could be, corresponding to a long wavelength in the probability cloud that the Schrodinger wave function describes.  However, when the particle has high momentum, it moves more deterministically in the given direction, resulting in a narrower range of variance around the particle's mean trajectory, resulting in a narrower effective wavelength along the direction of motion.  This is illustrated in the above figure.

## Differences Between Photons and Real Particles

Photons differ in so many ways from electrons and other particles, it is hard to imagine that both could be described by the same underlying mechanistic model.  Rest mass, charge, conserved number, fractional spin, etc.  In short, it is difficult to see how photons could be fit within the same paradigm.  The simplest approach at this point is to implement EM using classical Maxwell's equations.
